# Professional Portfolio

## This repository is a professional portfolio to showcase my projects with potential employers. I am actively building this portfolio as part of the bootcamp that I am attending. It will have links to GitHub repositories as well as deployed projects. These pages are responsive which means they scale to fit devices with various screen sizes. The responsiveness was achieved with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework. After several trials and errors, these are the steps that I took:

1. Start with the grid layout first (basically, boxes) and made it responsive by using various col-*-* classes.
2. Work on the background and text alignment of these grids (temporary borders around container, row and column).
3. Insert various types of elements into each column such as header, footer, navigation, and jumbotron.
4. Fix the alignment issues caused by the previous step.
5. Add content
6. Style one grid at a time. Use media queries if necessary.
7. Apply the style to other pages.

Note: After each step, it is important to commit changes.
